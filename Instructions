First Step is to create react project and upload it to the repo

to get api start the app.py file which will create local api server for you
http://localhost:5001
Note you might need to install new libraries for python.
Contact me if help needed.
Python used by me is 3.7.6

The data will be sent to the api only in POST and in the form of JSON Object.

Structure of JSON Object is defined in app.py in comments at the starting of the file after library imports.
